# Learning Objectives for Iteration 2 (Fall 2023)

## Course Learning Objectives
General course learning objectives presented in the syllabus: 

>At the completion of this course, students will be able to:
>
>1. Understand, execute, and debug R code  
>2. Work with data structures and packages in R related to identification, visualization, and interpretation of differentially expressed genes
>3. Critically evaluate scientific literature
>4. Draft a manuscript, including reproducible methods, background, results, and discussion

## Module Learning Objectives

Learning objectives for each module were listed in the module introduction page.  

### Module 1

>***Overview***
>
>Throughout the course, our learning objectives will focus on three specific areas: biology, coding, and professional development. In this module’s Biology learning objectives, we will learn about the biology behind the placenta, the technologies used to evaluate gene expression, the preprocessing steps used on our dataset, and the research aims for this course. In this module’s  Coding learning objectives, we will help you with getting connected to the high-performance biocomputing cluster at ASU (Agave) and use it to access RStudio, navigate directories, and copy files. In this module’s Professional Development learning objectives we will learn how to search for solutions to your coding challenges and get introduced to how to read a scientific paper.
>
>We have provided reading and resources on the next few pages to help you to have the necessary background for attaining the skills presented in this course and help you to contextualize the research question we are tackling.
>
>If you have questions about any of the content, please post in the course slack under the channel #module1; for assistance troubleshooting, please post in the #troubleshooting channel for class feedback. As a reminder, this is a judgment-free zone; the questions you have may very well be the same as another student so please feel free to post as needed.  Any good workplace or research environment should have ways you can communicate with others to get support.
>
>By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
