The readings we've chosen are all highly relevant to the class, the research and course materials. They will help you better understand the research question and the background behind the materials, methods, and technology. 

The readings will be available and graded through a Perusall link, as part of a Canvas page in each module.

In Perusall you can add your own comments and comment on other people's notes. 

The way we will grade these is:

70%: of the assignment is high quality comments (at least 4), not bunched up together, rather spread across the reading.
10%: Opening the assignment at least once.
10%: Reading to the end.
10%: At least 15 minutes of active engagement time with the reading.
