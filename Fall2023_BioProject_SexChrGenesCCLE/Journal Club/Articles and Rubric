The readings we've chosen are all highly relevant to the class, the research and course materials. They will help you better understand the research question and the background behind the materials, methods, and technology. 

The readings will be available and graded through a Perusall link, as part of a Canvas page in each module.
Articles and Suggested Notes by Module:
Module 1) CCLE Paper: Barretina, J., Caponigro, G., Stransky, N. et al. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity. Nature 483, 603–607 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11003

Module 2) Sex Determination Using RNAseq: Teixeira SA, Ibelli AMG, Cantão ME, Oliveira HC, Ledur MC, Peixoto JO, Marques DBD, Costa KA, Coutinho LL, Guimarães SEF. Sex Determination Using RNA-Sequencing Analyses in Early Prenatal Pig Development. Genes (Basel). 2019 Dec 5;10(12):1010. doi: 10.3390/genes10121010. PMID: 31817322; PMCID: PMC6947224.
For this week's journal club, we will be reading a paper where the authors are doing what we are trying to do with the CCLE but for a totally different purpose.  This paper uses RNA-seq to measure gene expression of pig embryos, specifically chromosome Y genes, to predict genetic sex.  Please highlight and comment on what you think is important, interesting, or confusing.  You will be graded on your participation in this discussion.

As you are reading the paper, take note of the following things: 

What genes are they using to predict sex? How did they select them?
How exactly did they make the prediction of male or female? 
How does this differ from what we are doing? 
How do they demonstrate that their method worked? 
Module 3) Tumor Suppressors that Escape XCI:Dunford A, Weinstock DM, Savova V, Schumacher SE, Cleary JP, Yoda A, Sullivan TJ, Hess JM, Gimelbrant AA, Beroukhim R, Lawrence MS, Getz G, Lane AA. Tumor-suppressor genes that escape from X-inactivation contribute to cancer sex bias. Nat Genet. 2017 Jan;49(1):10-16. doi: 10.1038/ng.3726. Epub 2016 Nov 21. PMID: 27869828; PMCID: PMC5206905.
For this week's journal club, we are reading a paper about a specific mechanism where X chromosome genes can contribute to a cancer development, tumor suppressors on the X chromosome escaping X chromosome inactivation in cancer.  Please highlight and comment on what you think is important, interesting, and confusing.  You will be graded on your participation in this discussion.

When reading this paper, ask yourself the following study questions: 

What is a tumor suppressor gene? 
Which tumor suppressor genes did they study? 
What was the data set they used to study the function of these genes in cancer? 
What kinds of alterations of these genes did they look for? 
Which cancers were these alterations associated with?
How did they measure X chromosome inactivation escape? 
What was their overall conclusion or model for how they think this mechanism works in cancer?

Module 4) Sex Differences in Cancer Mechanisms: Rubin JB, Lagas JS, Broestl L, Sponagel J, Rockwell N, Rhee G, Rosen SF, Chen S, Klein RS, Imoukhuede P, Luo J. Sex differences in cancer mechanisms. Biol Sex Differ. 2020 Apr 15;11(1):17. doi: 10.1186/s13293-020-00291-x. PMID: 32295632; PMCID: PMC7161126.
For this week's journal club, we will be reading a review article that goes over many different ways sex can affect cancer.  Please highlight and comment on what you think is important, interesting, or confusing.  You will be graded on your participation in this discussion. 

To help make sure you don’t get too lost in the details, as you go through the article ask yourself the following study questions: 

Which cancers that show a sex difference in incidence and survival, which sex tends to get cancer more often?
What hormones are likely to have an effect on tumor tissues when sex differences are observed? 
What is epigenetics? Studies on sex differences in epigenetics have been mostly performed in what organ? 
How can XX females be protected against the negative effects of cancer-causing mutations compared to XY males? 
What is metabolic reprogramming? Which metabolic processes are upregulated in males versus females? 
What is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer? How does this gene affect chromosome X gene expression? What other genes modulate the function of this gene differently in females versus males? 

Module 5) Chromosome Y Loss in Cancer: Abdel-Hafiz, H.A., Schafer, J.M., Chen, X. et al. Y chromosome loss in cancer drives growth by evasion of adaptive immunity. Nature 619, 624–631 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06234-x
For this week's journal club, we are going to read a paper that shows a specific mechanism by which chromosome Y loss can contribute to a cancer phenotype.  Please highlight and comment on what you find important, interesting, or confusing.  You will be graded on participation in this discussion.  

As you read this paper, think about the following questions: 

What kinds of health problems have been observed in males that have lost their Y chromosomes in specific cells? 
What kinds of model systems did they develop for use in this study? 
What Y chromosome genes did they study to assess loss of chrY? 
Was loss of chrY associated with better or worse prognosis for cancer patients? 
What did they measure to determine the behavior of cells with and without chrY?
What is CRISPR-Cas9 and what was this technique used for in this study? (Google stuff if you don’t know)
What changes to the immune cells in the tumors were observed with loss of chrY?
What were the key findings in this study? 
How did they test the importance of these findings for treating patients?
