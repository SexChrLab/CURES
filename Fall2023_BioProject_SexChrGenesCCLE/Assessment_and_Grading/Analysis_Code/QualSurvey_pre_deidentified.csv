Computational Life Science",5th year or more,Yes,"During my first research position I worked as an RA with Dr. Dennis Wilson at Mesa Community College investigating how fungal endophytes affect the production of secondary plant metabolites in Aristolochia watsonii (Southwestern Pipevine). My lab work primarily was fungal culturing, basic morphological identification of fungal species, DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing the ITS region, and preliminary identification of species via BLASTn. Additionally, I reviewed literature and produced a basic manuscript for my portion of the research. Based on the preliminary ITS results, I was able to identify one novel species. Unfortunately, the project was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally in Fall 2021 I participated in the SOLS Research Immersion Experience with Dr. Holechek. This covered additional lab techniques within the context of graduate research being conducted in the Holechek lab.

However most recently I completed a 10-month internship at the USDA's National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research where I conducted research in the Mycotoxin Prevention and Applied Microbiology Research Unit and ARS Culture Collection where I studied fungi associated with tar spot of corn. In addition to the same techniques I used during my Aristolochia research, I also learned additional DNA extraction protocols, performed sequencing reactions for NextGen sequencing, cleaned up reads in Sequencher and visualized and aligned using Geneious.

This unique opportunity gave me invaluable hands-on experience conducting field research in a diverse and challenging environment.

While in Panama, I actively participated in immersive field experiences encompassing various activities, including lectures, forest group hikes, and cultural expeditions. I had the chance to engage with the indigenous Embera community, visit the iconic Miraflores locks of the Panama Canal, and explore Panama City's colonial Old Quarter.

The core of my research activities during this expedition focused on an independent project centered around the observation and analysis of fluorescent organisms in Panama's rich biodiversity. Using calibrated UV light sources during nocturnal field observations, I meticulously documented fluorescent phenomena in various organisms, such as lichens, scorpions, and insect eggs. My research aimed to investigate the diversity and abundance of fluorescent lichens across different ecological settings. Additionally, I conducted correlation analyses to explore the relationship between lichen fluorescence and environmental variables, including sunlight exposure and human activity.

The outcomes of this research were captured in a comprehensive paper that elucidated the mechanisms and functions of lichen fluorescence. This experience not only contributed to our understanding of the physiological responses of lichens to environmental stimuli but also shed light on potential applications in environmental monitoring and biomonitoring.
