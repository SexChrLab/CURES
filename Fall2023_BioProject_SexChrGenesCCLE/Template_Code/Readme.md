The template code for this CURE allows students to load a matrix of gene expression data from the CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia), explore the samples in the data set, and visualize the expression of specific genes.  The code allows the student to specific the name of the gene they want specific information for, so it can be easily changed to analyse different genes.  Examples for XIST (analyzed first by the whole class) and one chromosome Y gene DDX3Y (analyzed by a specific small working group) are included.  This variable can be changed in the 'Gene of Interest' section.  Rmd files are provided for easy viewing and editting in RStudio along with reports (PDFs) to see the output students saw.
