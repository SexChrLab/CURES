3) Description:
4) Please refer to https://github.com/SexChrLab/Genomics_CURE/tree/a5751231bd6b117b80dea0760e9dc0f40b957a03/Courses/Trimming_FallB_2022 to access files used in the research analysis pipeline including:
5) data_generation
Contains all snakefiles used to generate and process trimmed data so it can be passed into differential expression pipeline.
6)cluster_submission
Contains sbatch scripts used to run snakefiles on ASU Agave biocomputing cluster
7)Differential_Expression
Contains Rmd files of the limma-voom differential expression pipeline, modified to run analysis for the CURE. This includes code to do pairwise comparison of two differentially expressed gene lists and an upset comparing the entire range of data sets.
