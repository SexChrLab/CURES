# Online genomics course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs)
This GitHub repository will hold all course materials for the asynchronous online genomics CUREs taught by Dr.Melissa Wilson in the Arizona State University School of Life Sciences.  Directories will be created for each iteration of the CURE so other instructors can use these materials to aide in the creation of their own research courses.  

## Fall 2022 Genomics Research Experience: Placenta Transcriptomics
In this pilot iteration of the CURE, we investigated the whether the list of sex differentially expressed genes identified in the human placenta was sensitive to changes in sequence quality trimming.  

## Fall 2023 Genomics Research Experience: Sex Chromosomes in the CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia)
In this CURE we inferred the sex chromosome complement in cancer cell lines using expression of a specific set sex chromosome genes.
