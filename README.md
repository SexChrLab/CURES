# CURES
Course based research experiences

This repository is home to code and learning materials used for the course-based research experiences we have designed and implemented. Below we summarize each iteration of the CURE.

## Fall 2022 Genomics Research Experience: Placenta Transcriptomics
In this pilot iteration of the CURE, we investigated the whether the list of sex differentially expressed genes identified in the human placenta was sensitive to changes in sequence quality trimming.  

## Fall 2023 Genomics Research Experience: Sex Chromosomes in the CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia)
In this CURE we inferred the sex chromosome complement in cancer cell lines using expression of a specific set sex chromosome genes.
